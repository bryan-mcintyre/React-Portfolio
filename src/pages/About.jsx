          My name is Bryan McIntyre and I&apos;m a junior developer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio is built using React.js. Some of the projects you&apos;ll find on my Projects page are built using other JS libraries including Express.js and Node.js. If you&apos;d like to connect with me, head over to the Contact page and I look forward to hearing from you!
